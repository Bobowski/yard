# Changelog

## 0.11.0

- `yard repo new` creates a private repo on GitHub or Origin for the checkout and pushes it: a commit, no `origin` remote, and a connected forge are all it asks. `--forge` picks one when both are connected. `yard app new --create-repo` does the same inline, and on a terminal `yard app new` offers it when no repo is found.
- New route `POST /api/v1/forges/{name}/repos` takes `{"name", "owner?"}` and answers `{"repo", "grant_url"}`; the grant URL names the GitHub installation settings page when a selected-repos installation cannot see the repo it just made.
- New GitHub setups request `repository_creation: write`; new Origin setups request `namespace:repositories:create`. An existing host adds the permission in the app's settings and accepts it on the installation; until then the route answers 403 `repo_permission`. Origin also needs an installation on all repositories.
- Yard never deletes a repo.
- The GitHub install step prints one line everywhere: "Install the app on your account and pick the repos Yard deploys."

## 0.10.0

- The repo moved to `github.com/stariodev/yard`. `install.sh` clones from there by default, and the image is `ghcr.io/stariodev/yard`.
- The GitHub forge keeps one installation per account. Installing the Yard app on a second account no longer replaces the first: each repo gets a token from the installation that owns it, `yard status --full` shows one installation row per account, and `yard forge setup github` offers "Add another account". An older `state.json` with one installation still works and is rewritten on the next save.
- Detect refusals say more: the nothing-found message lists Nushell and links to stario.dev/yard/what-runs#when-yard-refuses, and a Python repo with no entrypoint says `found a Stario app` or `found a Python app` instead of naming the marker file.
- `yard status` no longer sends `GET /` to each app; the state comes from Podman and its healthcheck. The `answers` field is gone from the status API. An app without a healthcheck that does not listen now shows `up` — add a `HEALTHCHECK` ([stario.dev/yard/compose#healthchecks](https://stario.dev/yard/compose#healthchecks)).
- `yard logs` printed every entry on one line: the text path joined the formatted entries with no separator, so `--tail 3` came back as a single glued line. Each journal entry is now its own line; the app page's log tail fixes the same way.
- `yard logs` filters on the host with repeatable `--hide EXPR` and `--only EXPR`: `key=value` / `key!=value` globs and `key>n` / `key<n` on a JSON record (a top-level key first, then `attributes`), anything else a substring glob on the message. Lines that share a `trace_id` keep or drop as one trace; `lines`/`--tail` still count entries read before filters, and a JSON page's cursor stays the last entry read. With no flags the output is unchanged.

## 0.9.1

- `yard app new --runs https://…/uptime-kuma.compose.yml` names the app `uptime-kuma`. Before, the name kept `.compose` and the command stopped with "name must be a short lowercase word", so the documented example failed without `--app`.

## 0.9.0

- Deploys are jobs. `POST /api/v1/apps/{name}/deploy` answers 202 with the job, `GET` on the same route returns it (`?follow=1` streams the log as `x-ndjson`, ending with the deploy object), and the app page gains a `job` field. Breaking for API callers that expected the deploy body back in the POST.
- `yard app deploy` and `yard app new` stream the deploy log live; `yard app logs --deploy` reads the job's lines.
- `yard app new` takes `-e/--env KEY=VALUE`, `--env-file`, and `--edit-env`, so the first deploy can have its settings.
- The one-time 0.8.0 record migration is removed: a host older than 0.8.0 upgrades to 0.8.0 first.
- The `yard status` bind column elides the app's own container (`host → :PORT` for another port, `host` for 8000).
- The settings hint stays a warning: it never blocks a deploy.

## 0.8.0

Breaking: the app record's four fields are one `runs`.

- `runs` replaces `containerfile`, `compose`, `image`, and `recipe`: `auto` (the default), a path in the repo, `yard:<template>`, an image `name:tag`, or an https URL to a compose file. A repo app runs a file from it; image and URL apps have no repo. Boot rewrites old records once.
- Recipes are gone. A URL in `runs` fetches any compose file; it cannot `build:` (there is no checkout) and the old `recipe/` directory becomes `compose/`.
- `yard app detect` and `deploy --sha` are gone. Roll back by changing the source: git revert, an older tag, or an older URL.
- The `yard:` templates are `python-uv`, `python-pip`, `go`, and `node-npm`, pinned to index digests (`detect/bases.json`; `just bump-bases` refreshes). The rendered Containerfile's hash joins the deployed revision, so a template change redeploys once. One deploy path and one check loop cover every kind.
- `POST`/`PATCH /api/v1/apps` reject unknown fields with `unknown_field`. `app_json` carries `runs` and a `deployed` object; the files route reads the deployed answer.
- Removed old-host compatibility: `up-`/`-job` containers, routes without an id, the :8443 Caddy convergence, the account backfill, and install.sh's yardd/podman-static/tailscale/caddy.service cleanup. Off-host `yard status --full` omits the skipped rows.
- `app new --public` binds after the first deploy, on the port the container exposes (`--port` overrides; a repo app falls back to 8000).
- An image or URL app has an empty `ref`; setting one is a 400 `bad_ref`. The `yard app ls` column is `source`.
- New template `yard:http-nu` runs cross.stream (xs) apps: a repo with `serve.nu` gets a static http-nu binary (sha256-checked per arch), a persistent xs store in `/data/store`, and the Datastar bundle served. The env hint reads `$env.KEY`.

## 0.7.0

- `yard forge setup github` creates the GitHub App with the manifest flow: one click, and GitHub sends the key and the webhook secret back. `--manual` keeps the paste flow.
- `yard app new` deploys right away; `--no-deploy` only creates the app.
- `yard app rm` lists what it removes and asks first; `--with-binds` removes the app's binds too, and `--yes` skips the question.
- A daily prune removes old images that Yard built.
- `yard status --full` warns about an app with no healthcheck.
- `install.sh --domain` writes the bind for Yard itself.
- CLI errors name the next command to run.

## 0.6.2

- Yard mounts the host's Podman socket directory, not the socket file, so a restart of `podman.socket` (an install.sh repair run or a Podman upgrade) no longer leaves Yard unable to reach Podman until its container restarts.

## 0.6.1

- `install.sh` targets Ubuntu 26.04 LTS and uses its podman package (5.x) instead of podman-static 6.1.4. It refuses Podman older than 5 and warns on another OS. It removes the 0.6.0 `podman.service` drop-in if present.
- The podman-remote in the Yard and apply images moves to 5.7.0 to match the host.

## 0.6.0

- `install.sh` installs a pinned Podman (podman-static 6.1.4) under `/usr/local` and points yard's `podman.service` at it. Podman 4.9's compat API does not return container labels on the list endpoint, so Compose recreated every container on every `up` — including Caddy on each Yard self-deploy. On Podman 6 an unchanged service stays up. The first Podman 6 run migrates the BoltDB state to SQLite.
- The podman-remote in the Yard and apply images moves to 6.1.4 to match, and the Yard image now verifies its checksum.
- `yard podman` and `POST /api/v1/podman` are gone. Events and logs come from journald, `status` already carries restarts, health, oom, exit error, cpu, and mem, and `ssh` covers ad-hoc podman.
- The doctor `disk` row says where the space went: filesystem free, image size and reclaimable from `podman system df`, total app data, and the journal.
- A deploy on a GitHub repo posts a commit status on the sha (context `yard`): `pending` while it runs, `success` live (linked to the app's public host) or `failure` on a revert or error, and a boot marks the running yard commit `live`. The GitHub App needs `Commit statuses: Read and write` — `yard forge setup github` asks for it — and doctor shows a `<forge> status` row with the last report or its error.

## 0.5.0

Yard no longer hosts git. Cursor Origin is the git host. There is no migration path; rebuild the host and reconnect it by hand.

- `repos/` and `worktree/` are gone. `apps/<name>/repo` is a plain clone that a deploy resets to the remote tip of the ref.
- The app record is exactly `repo`, `ref`, `trigger`, and `created`. `dir` is gone. A trigger is `push` or `manual`; `every` is gone.
- Two forges: Cursor Origin and GitHub, both as Apps. An app's `repo` is the full `https://<host>/<owner>/<name>` URL; the host picks the forge.
- Everything observable goes through journald: container logs, Podman container events, and Yard's own events (`hook.received`, `check.moved`, `deploy.*`, `app.*`, `env.set`, `bind.*`, `token.*`, `forge.*`, `prune`). Yard writes its events to the native journald socket, `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=yard` with `YARD_*` fields; a missing socket falls back to one JSON line on stdout. No secret ever becomes a field.
- `GET /api/v1/logs` reads any container's journal log by name or id; `GET /api/v1/events` is the merged Podman+Yard timeline (JSON, NDJSON on `follow=1`). `GET /api/v1/apps/{name}/logs` is gone — `yard app logs` and `yard logs` use the new routes, and `yard events` shows the timeline.
- The deploy gate is `compose up -d --wait`: a healthcheck the app's compose file defines decides healthy (the settle window and `YARD_SETTLE_SECONDS` are gone). A failed `up` reverts to the previous image and the outcome is `reverted`.
- One deploy path: `POST /api/v1/apps/{name}/deploy` takes an optional `sha` (`yard app deploy --sha SHA`). A prefix resolves against the deploy journal; an image the host still holds skips the build. Rollback is gone — an older revision is a deploy of that sha.
- The apply container is `deploy-<name>` (was `up-<name>`); a leftover `up-` container still reads as the deploy record.
- The API contracts are trimmed: `GET /api/v1/apps/{name}` is the full app page (the `/status` route is gone), binds are `PUT|DELETE /api/v1/binds/{host}`, and the forge key/installation routes are gone — `GET /api/v1/forges` reports the Origin public key, discovers the installation, and carries `selection` and `error`.
- The CLI loses `app show`, `app history`, `app rollback`, and `bind new`. `app status` reads the app page, `bind set` takes the host as an argument, and `forge setup` polls `GET /api/v1/forges` for the installation.
- Status rows carry the container `id` plus `oom` and `error` for a stopped container.
- `yard forge setup origin` and `yard forge setup github` connect the host from the laptop. Each prints the app values, opens the create and install links, and waits for the install. `install.sh` no longer asks for a repo or runs setup; it prints the next steps.
- `/hooks/origin` takes Origin events; `/hooks/github` takes GitHub events and verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` before anything else. A push schedules a repo check; a burst folds into one check now and one at the end of the window. A full check runs every `YARD_CHECK_SECONDS` (five minutes).
- A deploy syncs the clone through the repo's forge — the ref tip, or one commit with `--sha` — builds `localhost/<name>:<sha12>`, and runs compose up. The token never lands in `.git/config`.
- Containers log to journald. `GET /api/v1/logs`, `yard logs`, and `yard app logs` read them back — the log survives the container. `install.sh` writes the journald and Podman config.
- The yard app still deploys itself: push to its Origin repo, detached apply, `pending` outcome.
- Removed: smart-HTTP git hosting, `/api/v1/repos*`, `repo`/`git`/`init`/`clone`/`up`/`caddy` CLI commands, `app edit` and `app run`, deploy outcomes `superseded`, `waiting`, `current`, the merge/delete app cleanup, and the projects→apps layout migration.
- New env API: `GET|PATCH|PUT /api/v1/apps/{name}/env`. App responses never carry env.
- Doctor gains five rows per connected forge: app, installation, token, webhook, check.
- The code is three layers in about 20 modules: `app.shared`, `app.cli`, and `app.server` (api, services, adapters). The server is `python -m app.server.main`; the CLI script is unchanged.
- Push and installation events debounce with a leading plus trailing check, so a burst never waits five minutes.
- Every disk write is atomic. The git adapter raises `YardError` like the others. The CLI times calls out at 30 seconds (deploy at 30 minutes; streams never).
- Caddy's admin API is a unix socket at `apps/yard/caddy/run/admin.sock`. The curl-to-admin path and the autosave reads are gone.
- HTTP/3 is on. Caddy listens on 443 inside its container, the host publishes 8443 for TCP and UDP, and nft redirects public 443 for both protocols, so Alt-Svc's `h3=":443"` is a port clients can reach. An existing host must rerun `install.sh` — or add `udp dport 443 redirect to :8443` to the yard nft table and allow `8443/udp` in ufw — for UDP to reach Caddy.
- `yard forge setup github` recovers: a bad App ID or an unreadable key path re-prompts instead of exiting (quotes and `\ ` escapes on a pasted path come off), a 4xx on the forge PUT asks again, and a stopped run continues on the next `yard forge setup github` with the same webhook secret — `--new` starts over. A run against a host that already holds the app id skips to the install step; a connected forge exits early.

## 0.4.0

The store is files. One project is one directory. Move the host files once, then rerun `install.sh`.

- `projects/<name>/project` holds repo, ref, dir, trigger, and created. Env is `projects/<name>/env`. Data is `projects/<name>/data`. The checkout is `projects/<name>/worktree`.
- The command and the API say project. A container gets `PROJECT_NAME` and `PROJECT_DATA_DIR`.
- A project write saves the file. `yard up` builds it. `yard clone --ref` adds a feature project, and a merge removes it.
- Binds are `/api/v1/binds`. Caddy keeps its autosave under the yard project.
- `yard prune` removes unused localhost images.

## 0.3.1

Formatting only. `app/api.py` and `app/git.py` are reformatted under the locked ruff 0.17 so CI's `ruff format --check` agrees with the workspace's local run. No behavior change.

## 0.3.0

Stario 5.0 and a round of hardening after the 0.2 cutover. Same install.sh path.

- The table names the container (`engratia-app-1`); an idle row keeps the slot name. CPU and memory read the keys Podman actually prints.
- Image tags use twelve chars of sha. Yard's own containers follow the compose convention: `yard-app-1`, `yard-caddy-1`.
- Caddy no longer recreates on a Yard self-deploy. Its seed file mounts from a stable path under `run/` and the admin socket is fixed.
- The recurring container healthcheck is gone. The apply probe is the only readiness gate; the healthcheck alone was about half of Yard's idle CPU.
- The apply image builds with podman-remote, not the Compose API path.
- `YardError` renders on every route through `catch_errors`; anything else gets the framework's 500. A log follow drains its writer and stops on disconnect.
- install.sh fails early without root, installs `sudo`, and creates `checkouts/` itself. `saved_project` ensures the slot env file.
- `staryard` is a virtual package (`package = false`). The image ships `app/` as source; `uv build` still publishes the PyPI wheel.

## 0.2.0

A rewrite of the server and the command. Same host design: bare git repos, rootless Podman, Compose, Caddy. Backwards incompatible; rerun `install.sh` on the host and `uv tool upgrade staryard` on the laptop.

- One apply container does the whole deploy: build, start, probe, revert. `yard deploys <slot> <id>` is that one log, and a Yard self-upgrade reverts on its own.
- A repo's compose file runs as it is. No generated override. The contract: `image: ${IMAGE}`, `build.context: ${CHECKOUT}`, network `yard` with alias `${SLOT_NAME}`, `env_file: ${APP_ENV}`, `${DATA_DIR}:/data`. Yard checks it before the build.
- Slot env is a file, `/srv/yard/env/<slot>.env`, mode 600. Not in SQLite.
- `TRIGGER` replaces `--every`: empty is a service; `push`, `manual`, or `every 1h` make a job. `yard run <slot>` runs any slot now.
- New: `yard status <slot>`, `yard doctor`, `yard prune`. The table says `no answer` and counts restarts. `yard` alone prints the table.
- Gone: experiments, the token tree, `yard.*` labels, `yard logs --sha`, the `revert` role, the `STARIO_*` defaults Yard injected. `token revoke` is `token rm`.
- Host: `build/` is `checkouts/`; Caddy's first config is `ops/caddy.json`; the apply container is started with `podman run`, no apply compose file.

Migration: slots with `every` become `TRIGGER=every <interval>`; slot env values are not carried over, enter them again with `yard slot edit`; revoked tokens are deleted.

## 0.1.1

- An update keeps the running container until the new image answers `/health`.
- The swap no longer passes `--group-add keep-groups` to remote Podman.

## 0.1.0

- First release of the `yard` command.
- The PyPI package name is `staryard`.
- `yard --version` prints this version.
