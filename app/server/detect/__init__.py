"""What an app runs when its record does not say: a repo compose, a repo Containerfile, or a written one.

A detector is one module in this package for one language or framework. It exposes:

- LANGUAGE: the language it is an opinionated kind of (several detectors may share one).
- MARKERS: repo files that prove the language is present (first match names the language).
- detect(repo, name) -> Plan | None: None means "not mine"; YardError means "mine but broken".
- settings(repo) -> list[Setting], optional: the env keys the code reads.

A detector imports Repo, Plan, Setting, SET_BY_YARD, pin, and plan_template from detect.base.
A generated Containerfile lives in templates/ next to this file and renders through render.
Every FROM and COPY --from in a template is pinned to an index digest in bases.json.
A detector must refuse (YardError or None) rather than guess an install or entrypoint.

A PR adding a detector adds the module, its template, a bases.json pin, an entry in
DETECTORS (specific before generic), and tests under tests/server/.
